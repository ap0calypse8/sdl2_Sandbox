# SDL2 Sandbox

Welcome to the SDL2 Sandbox repository! This repository serves as a playground for various projects built using SDL2, a popular multimedia library for graphics applications. Each project within this repository demonstrates different aspects of SDL2 usage, from simple graphics rendering to more complex simulations.

## Projects

### 1. Random Walk

The Random Walk project simulates a random walk algorithm using SDL2. It generates a series of random movements on a 2D grid and visualizes the path taken by a particle. This project is a simple demonstration of graphics rendering and basic animation with SDL2.

### 2. Mandelbrot Set Visualization

The Mandelbrot Set Visualization project renders the Mandelbrot set using SDL2. It explores the fascinating mathematical world of fractals by visualizing the Mandelbrot set, a complex and infinitely detailed mathematical object. This project showcases advanced graphics rendering techniques with SDL2.

### 3. Goldbach's Comet Visualization

A visualization of the hypothetical "Goldbach's Comet" created using the SDL2 library. Inspired by the unsolved Goldbach Conjecture in number theory.
The Goldbach Conjecture, proposed by Christian Goldbach in 1742, states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
Explore the celestial wonder of this mathematical curiosity through this simulation.

## Getting Started
