# Random Walk Visualization

This project is a simple visualization of a random walk using SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library in C++. In a random walk, a point moves randomly in space according to certain rules, creating an interesting pattern over time.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- SDL2 library

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure that SDL2 library is installed on your system.
3. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler with SDL2 linked.





## Features

- Visualization of a two-dimensional random walk on a grid.
- Each step in the random walk is represented by a point on the grid.
- Colors of the points change dynamically based on their position, creating an interesting visual effect.

## Configuration

- You can adjust the grid size and other parameters directly in the source code (`randomwalk.cpp`).
- Modify the delay time to change the speed of the random walk.
